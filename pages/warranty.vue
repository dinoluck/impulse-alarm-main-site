          <h2 id="equipment-warranty">Equipment Warranty</h2>
          <p class="text-justify">
            During the first 90 days following installation, any necessary
            repairs or replacements of our equipment or labor will be provided
            free of charge.
          </p>
          <p class="text-justify">
            After the initial 90-day period and up until the end of the first
            year, if any equipment malfunctions or requires repairs, you will be
            responsible for a $59 trip fee for a technician to visit your
            location. However, all equipment will still be covered by the
            manufacturer's warranty during this time.
          </p>
          <p class="text-justify">
            At the one-year mark, you will have three options:
          </p>
          <p class="text-justify">
            <span class="text-black">No Extended Warranty</span> — if you choose
            not to purchase a warranty plan, any repairs or replacements needed
            will be charged at a rate of $149 per hour, and any necessary
            equipment will need to be purchased.
          </p>
          <p class="text-justify">
            <span class="text-black">Silver Extended Warranty Plan</span> — for
            a monthly fee of $2.99, and a $79 trip fee, all equipment will
            continue to be covered under the manufacturer's warranty, and all
            labor needed for any repairs will be provided at no additional cost.
          </p>
          <p class="text-justify">
            <span class="text-black">Gold Extended Warranty Plan</span> — for a
            monthly fee of $4.99, and a $59 trip fee, all equipment will
            continue to be covered under the manufacturer's warranty, and all
            labor needed for any repairs will be provided at no additional cost.
